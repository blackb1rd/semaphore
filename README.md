If your project has grown and deploying from the terminal is no longer feasible, then Semaphore UI is the tool you need.

## What is Semaphore UI?

Semaphore UI is a modern web interface for managing popular DevOps tools.

Semaphore UI allows you to:
* Easily run Ansible playbooks, Terraform and OpenTofu code, as well as Bash and PowerShell scripts.
* Receive notifications about failed tasks.
* Control access to your deployment system.

## Key Concepts

1. **Projects** is a collection of related resources, configurations, and tasks.
2. **Task Templates** are reusable definitions of tasks that can be executed on demand or scheduled.
3. **Task** is a specific instance of a job or operation executed by Semaphore.
4. **Schedules** allow you to automate task execution at specified times or intervals.
5. **Inventory** is a collection of target hosts (servers, virtual machines, containers, etc.) on which tasks will be executed.
6. **Variable Group** refers to a configuration context that holds sensitive information such as environment variables and secrets used by tasks during execution.
